When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my work with other people, because I would probably want to work with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably because if I work with others on a repository, for example, and someone pushes a new commit on Github, I may not want to save it on my local repository.
