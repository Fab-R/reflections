When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my work with other people, because I would probably want to work with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably because if I work with others on a repository, for example, and someone pushes a new commit on Github, I may not want to save it on my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks : they're like clones, but they exist only on repositories specifically provided by Github.
Clones: unlike forks, they can be referred to any repository.
Branches : do not have anything in common with forks and clones. Git clone and git fork operate on branches. They're different concepts

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you screw up something with your branch, you can always return to the previous (correct) state of your work. Quite cool.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would send single files if they're short, or probably just send them my lines changes. It would probably be harder to do all of that manually!
