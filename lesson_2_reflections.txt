What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It becomes a git repository. I need it to start doing my commits!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is just a temporary area, on which I can't run  all the git commands that work on working directory and the repository instead. 
It is useful because if I am not sure about the commit I want to make, I can always reset everything and start again.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Not sure. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Not sure. Again.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me because I can understand more clearly what commits I made through the various branches. I can therefore make better decisions for my project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

We get a new branch, including :
-common lines;
-new lines added either by one author or the other(s).
A diagram helps us to visualize better the commits we made.
