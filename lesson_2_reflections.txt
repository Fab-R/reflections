What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It becomes a git repository. I need it to start doing my commits!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is just a temporary area, on which I can't run  all the git commands that work on working directory and the repository instead. 
It is useful because if I am not sure about the commit I want to make, I can always reset everything and start again.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Not sure. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Not sure. Again.
